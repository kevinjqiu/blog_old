They say the best way to learn a new programming language is by programming in it. Therefore I’m starting this project converting algorithms in the book [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321) into Clojure, while learning the best practices and language idioms during the process.

I’ve created a GitHub [project](http://github.com/kevinjqiu/pci-clj) for this. I’m not sure how far I’m able to go but let’s see.
