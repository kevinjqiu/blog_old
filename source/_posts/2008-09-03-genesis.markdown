Well, I’ve been thinking about going back into blogging for some time now…I haven’t been able to make the determination.  However, now I think the era I’m going through right now is too precious to go wasted and without any trace.  So, I’m going to try my best to write blog more often to record this period, although not everything is wonderful and pleasant, the memories will be there forever and will remain part of myself.  Looking back several years later, even the bitterest moment will be just as precious and every bereavement I go through will be an asset to my life.
