    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's been a while since the last time I wrote about Python. This morning, I was listening to a podcast on my way to work. They were discussing functional programming and dynamic languages...I learned Python before I went into Computer Science, and then I learned about functional programming and through learning of Scala and Clojure, my functional programming concepts have been enriched. As I was listening, it suddenly appeared to me that there isn't a way in Python to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curry</a> a function. Not that it's critical to everyday development, but wouldn't it be neat if I can curry a function in Python?</p>

<p>Then the hosts of the podcast discussed how dynamic languages are so flexible that you can pretty much do anything to it. "You can take a function as parameter, return a function from a function, and so on." Hey, isn't that what Python's <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=240808">decorator</a> can do? I learned decorators before, but I haven't used it beyond the scope of creating properties and certainly haven't written any decorators. I thought this would be a good exercise for learning decorators.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of what function currying: suppose you have a method</p>

<p><code>python
def add(x,y):
  return x+y
</code></p>

<p>Then calling <code>add(1,2)</code> should be the same as <code>add(1)(2)</code>. <code>add(1)</code> is what they call a partially applied function. It's a function that takes one parameter.</p>

<p>Our goal here is to write a decorator "curried" that takes a function with n parameters and transform it in a way that can be applied n times and get the final result.</p>

<p>We'll start with unit tests first:</p>

<p>```python
import unittest</p>

<p>class CurryTest(unittest.TestCase):</p>

<pre><code>def test_with_no_args(self):
    @curried
    def do_nothing():
        return ""
    self.assertEquals("", do_nothing())

def test_with_int_args(self):
    @curried
    def add_int(x,y):
        return x+y
    self.assertEquals(3, add_int(1)(2))
def test_with_str_args(self):
    @curried
    def add_str(x,y):
        return "%s%s"%(x,y)
    self.assertEquals("ab", add_str("a")("b"))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>So we make sure that a currying on a function takes no parameter is valid but should be a pass through, and also the "curried" decorator can be applied to any function with arguments (excluding positional arguments and keyword arguments)</p>

<p>A decorator is simply a function that takes a function as parameter:
<code>python
def curried(fn):
  pass
</code>
and <code>@curried</code> is simply a syntactic sugar for:</p>

<p><code>python
def fn(...): ...
fn=curried(fn)
</code></p>

<p>So, now we can write <code>curried</code> decorator.
To make the test for function with no argument pass, in <code>curried()</code> function, we can test to see if fn has arguments. Python's standard library provides <code>inspect.getargspec</code> method:</p>

<p>```python
def curried(fn):
  argspec = inspect.getargspec(fn)
  if len(argspec.args)==0:</p>

<pre><code>return fn
</code></pre>

<p>  else:</p>

<pre><code># later
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now the first test passes.</p>

<p>For the other two cases, here's the strategy. In Python, when a class defines <code>__call__</code> method, the instance of that class is said to be "callable". For instance:</p>

<p>```python
class A(object):
  def <strong>call</strong>(self, arg):</p>

<pre><code>return arg
</code></pre>

<p>f=A()
f("echo")  # this gives you "echo"
```</p>

<p>This is very similar to Scala's <code>apply()</code> function. Now that we have this in our inventory, we can define a <code>PartialFunction</code> class, take all the required parameters of the original function, and allow them to be applied one at a time. So the <code>__call__</code> method of PartialFunc will look like this:</p>

<p><code>python
def __call__(self, value):
  # Xxx
</code></p>

<p>If all the required parameters are passed in, <code>PartialFunc</code> should evaluate the original function with the complete argument list. Otherwise, <code>PartialFunc</code> stores the parameter in an instance variable, and returns itself.</p>

<p>Here's the complete code:
```python
class PartialFunc(object):</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, fn, argspec):
    self.fn = fn
    self.argspec = argspec 
    self.args = []

def __call__(self, value):
    self.args.append(value) 
    if len(self.args) == len(self.argspec.args):
        arglist = ",".join(["self.args[%d]"%i for i in range(0, len(self.args))])
        return eval("self.fn(" + arglist + ")")
    else:
        return self
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>and the curried decorator:
```python
def curried(fn):</p>

<pre><code>argspec = inspect.getargspec(fn)
if len(argspec.args) == 0:
    return fn
else:
    return PartialFunc(fn, argspec)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>It's pretty straightforward. When the parameters are complete, I construct a python statement that calls the original function with the complete argument list, and then pass the statement into an eval statement. I know evals are evil, but I can't find a way in Python to dynamically change the signature of the original method and make it accept a variable length argument (varargs).</p>

<p>So this is it. It's quite simple. Python methods can have varargs and keyword args, the situation gets a little more complicated. The thing is, both varargs and keyword args are not mandatory, so it's hard for the curried function to know whether the argument list has been completed...Also, if you take default values into account, it could get even more complicated.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The problem is taken from <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project-Euler</a>, which asks what is the sum of all prime numbers under 2 million.</p>

<h2>Traditional Approach</h2>

<p>Project-Euler has many problems like this which looks ridiculously easy in theory, but practically impossible when using the old-school brute force way to solve them.</p>

<p>Even after applying some well-known techniques to shrink the problem space, the computation still takes a long time (too long for me to stick around and wait it to finish). I tried using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, and the performance isn’t satisfying to say the least.</p>

<p>```erlang
solve() -></p>

<pre><code>sum_all_primes_under(2000000).
</code></pre>

<p>sum_all_primes_under(To) -></p>

<pre><code>sieve(lists:seq(2, To), To).
</code></pre>

<p>sieve([], _) -> 0;
sieve(List, Range) -></p>

<pre><code>[Max|_] = lists:reverse(List),
case Max  List;
    false -&gt;
        [H|Rest] = List,
        io:format("~p ~n", [H]),
        H + sieve(lists:filter(fun(X)-&gt;X rem H =/= 0 end, Rest), Range)
end.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>One thing to take note is that when executing the above program, only one core of the CPU is effectively utilized.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/cpu1.png"></p>

<h2>Concurrency Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>In the concurrency oriented programming (COP, a term coined by Erlang’s inventor Joe Armstrong) model, you’re thinking in terms of separate entities and what responsibility is there for each of them. Think of them as individual human beings. They don’t have shared brains; one cannot influence the other by simply modify his or her brain tissues (well, under normal circumstance anyway). As human beings, our brains are disconnected from each other, <strong>but</strong> we share our knowledge through communication. We can modify other people’s memories by sending messages and vice versa. This is essentially what COP is – the entities are processes, and each has individual memories that’s not modifiable by other processes. Processes communicate with each other through message sending/receiving. This model is particularly good for scaling. Because the entities share nothing, it’s easy to get more entities without worrying that they don’t get along.</p>

<p>Back to our problem. With the traditional approach, one process is to iterate through the 2 million numbers, determine if it’s a prime number, and add to the tally if it is. Think of it as one man doing all the job that there is.</p>

<p>With the new model, here are the actors in our system:</p>

<p><strong>Worker</strong>: A worker is responsible for gathering the prime numbers in a given range (sufficiently small), add them and report them to the tallier.</p>

<p><strong>Tallier</strong>: A tallier waits for the results from the workers and sum the results up.</p>

<p><strong>Manager (Solver)</strong>: The manager is responsible for dividing up the task, hiring workers to finish the task and tell the tallier which worker has been given a task so that the tallier can wait for the specific workers to send back the results.</p>

<p>```erlang worker
worker() -></p>

<pre><code>receive
    {TallierPid, L} -&gt;
        Sum = lists:sum(lists:filter(fun(X)-&gt;mylib:is_prime(X) end, L)),
        TallierPid ! {self(), Sum}
end.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The worker code is quite simple. After it’s created (hired by the manager), it waits for the manager to send over <code>{TallierPid, L}</code>, with <code>L</code> being the list of integers to work with. Then it filters out the prime numbers, and call <code>lists:sum()</code> on the result list, which gives the sum of the prime numbers in the list <code>L</code>.</p>

<p>This doesn’t seem to look different if we were writing in the traditional way. Yes, but feeding the key difference here is that <strong>we’re not going to ask one worker to solve the entire problem domain</strong>. Instead, the manager is going to <strong>divide the task into smaller tasks so that it takes almost no time for a single worker to finish his or her work</strong>.</p>

<p>```erlang manager
solve() -></p>

<pre><code>TallierPid = spawn(euler, tallier, [self(), [], 0, false]),
solver(TallierPid, 2, 2000000),
%% worker assignment has finished
TallierPid ! { self(), true },

receive
    {TallierPid, Result} -&gt;
        io:format("Final tally: ~p ~n", [Result])
end.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is only half of the manager code. First it spawns a tallier. We’ll look at the tallier code later.
<code>solver(TallierPid, 2, 2000000)</code> is the worker assignment part, which is shown directly after this section.</p>

<p>After the worker assignment, the manager simply informs the tallier that the worker assignment has done, and sits there, waiting for the tallier to report the final result.</p>

<p>```erlang manager (cont.)
solver(TallierPid, From, To) -></p>

<pre><code>case (To - From) of
     SmallRange when SmallRange =&lt; 1000 -&gt;
        List = lists:seq(From, To),
        WorkerPid = spawn(fun worker/0),
        %% register the worker with tallier
        TallierPid ! { self(), WorkerPid },
        %% send the problem for the worker to work out
        WorkerPid ! { TallierPid, List };
    _ -&gt;
        Mid = mylib:floor((To + From) div 2),
        solver(TallierPid, From, Mid),
        solver(TallierPid, Mid+1, To)
end.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This code defines the problem domain, splits the work, hire workers and assign the split work to them. It’s a classic divide-and-conquer structure, however, we have to be careful not to make the range too small, as the number of processes may (or in this case, will) exceed the default system limit. As I tested, my computer can sum prime numbers from a list of 1000 elements in a heartbeat so I just chose that number to be the upper bound of the size for each worker to work on.</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

<p>```erlang tallier
tallier(SolverPid, Workers, X, AssignFinished) -></p>

<pre><code>receive
    {SolverPid, true} -&gt;
        %% This message is from the solver
        %% It tells the tallier that
        %% worker assignment has finished
        tallier(SolverPid, Workers, X, true);
    {SolverPid, WorkerPid} -&gt;
        %% This message is from the solver
        %% Register WorkerPid
        tallier(SolverPid, [WorkerPid | Workers], X, AssignFinished);
    {WorkerPid, Sum} -&gt;
        Tally = X + Sum,
        %% Remove worker from Workers list
        NewWorkerList = Workers -- [WorkerPid],
        case AssignFinished of
            true -&gt;
                case NewWorkerList of
                    [] -&gt;
                        SolverPid ! { self(), Tally };
                    _ -&gt; tallier(SolverPid, NewWorkerList, Tally, AssignFinished)
                end;
            _ -&gt; tallier(SolverPid, NewWorkerList, Tally, AssignFinished)
        end
end.
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The tallier keeps track of 4 “variables”:
1. The Solver’s ID – to recognize messages from the solver and to report final tally to the solver.
2. A list of <code>Worker</code>s’ IDs whose results have been reported yet.
3. <code>X</code> – The previous tally.
4. <code>AssignFinished</code> – a flag indicating that all workers have been assigned.</p>

<p>The tallier has to look after three types of messages:
1. Message from the manager that the job has been divided up and the workers have been dispatched. In this case, the tallier knows that when the <code>Worker</code>s list gets down to empty, the computation is finished.
2. Message from the manager that registers a worker with the tallier. The tallier adds this worker’s ID to the <code>Worker</code>s list and waits for that worker to return his or her result.
3. Message from the worker indicating the worker’s ID and the result. The tallier removes the worker’s ID from the waiting pool and adds the result to the tally. When the waiting pool is empty and <code>AssignFinished</code> is true, it signals the end of the job and thus the tallier reports the final tally to the manager (solver).</p>

<p>There we go!  Running the program on my work computer (QuadCore) gives me the correct result in less than 5 seconds. About 8 seconds for my laptop (which is a Core 2 Duo). Non of this is even remotely imaginable with the traditional approach.</p>

<p>Also, as you may have guessed, all cores on the CPU are fully utilized.</p>
