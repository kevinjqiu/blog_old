    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like working in the command prompt - it's fast and you can do batch processing, etc, but sometimes, I need a GUI (Windows explorer) to explore files in the current directory. I know I can type "explorer.exe" on the command line to launch Windows explorer, but can it automatically go to the directory I'm working in? The answer is yes, although hardly ever <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314853" title="">advertised</a></p>

<p>Now, we need to find a way to find out the current working directory. On the command prompt, it's stored in the environment variable %CD%, so combine the two:</p>

<p><code>
explorer /root,%CD%
</code></p>

<p>and it works beautifully.</p>

<p>Put this in a .bat file and put it on your path, you can launch Windows explorer anywhere and have it go directly to the folder you're in on the command line!</p>
